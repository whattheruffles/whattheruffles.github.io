                    I am nothing more than a boy, a man on a mission to serve the nation. Beffudled in my quests to fuflill the duty handed to me by the authority of the government, i seek a mentor willing to educate me in this journey of self realizations and epiphanies. I take this single step so i may further fulfill my role as both a willing servant of the state and a mentor to those who have lost their way. Pray not for those who are lost, but for those wish not to be found! May thunder strike every inch of their bodies and teach them the lessons of nature; the gentle caress of the autumn wind, the swinging leaves riding the weather, the bamboo shoots sturdy in winter, the insect swarm in the soaking heat of summer, drowning your breaths in the storm of the earth, swallow them dry and spit them out anew! Cave Adsum!
